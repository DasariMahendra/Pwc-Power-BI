#  ðŸ“ŠPwC Switzerland Job Simulation (Forage)

This repository contains a series of Power BI projects based on a job simulation provided by [**PwC Switzerland** through **Forage**](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/pwc-ch/power-bi-cqxg). The aim is to gain hands-on experience with data analysis and visualization tools like Power BI, focusing on real-world business challenges such as customer retention, call center performance, and diversity & inclusion initiatives.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project is part of the PwC Power BI Analyst case study, where we analyze business data to derive meaningful insights and improve decision-making. It involves:

- ðŸ“Œ Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)
- ðŸ“Š Data Modeling & Relationships
- ðŸ“ˆ Interactive Dashboards & Reports
- ðŸ“Ž DAX Measures & Calculations
- ðŸ“‰ Business Insights & Recommendations

The simulation is divided into three different very insightful projects:
1. **Call Center Trends Analysis**: Visualizing customer satisfaction and agent performance.
2. **Customer Retention Analysis**: Identifying key metrics to predict customer churn and improve loyalty.
3. **Diversity & Inclusion Analysis**: Tracking and improving gender balance at the executive level.
